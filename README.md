- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GlennUbly. I am a data analyst working in the NHS, making use of GitHub as I work on my Python skills. 
I am now part of the HSMA4 programme https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/news/hsma-4-launches/.
I may be using repositories here for related work, and some personal projects.
My current focus is on getting to grips with Streamlit in the hope that I can make good use of it for my HSMA project, other aspects of my work, and more generally.

GlennUbly/GlennUbly is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
