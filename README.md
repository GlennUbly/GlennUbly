- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GlennUbly. I am a data analyst working in the NHS, making use of GitHub as I work on my Python skills. 
The Python I learned was part of the HSMA4 programme https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/news/hsma-4-launches/.
I may be using repositories here for related work, and some personal projects.
My original focus was on getting to grips with Streamlit in order to make good use of it for my HSMA project, other aspects of my work, and more generally.
I am hoping to add more fun stuff when I get time!
